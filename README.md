# Text Processing Project

This project focuses on processing and organizing crime statistics from different years. It includes two main components:
1. **Regular Crime Statistics**: These are individual crimes listed with details like crime type, date, and location.
2. **Summary Crime Statistics**: These statistics provide summarized crime data, categorized by offense, state, month, etc.

## Features

- **Crime Statistics Parsing**: The project processes crime statistics data and prints the results, categorized by year.
- **Summary Statistics Handling**: The project also handles summarized statistics and groups them by various categories.
- **Flexible Data Handling**: It can process both individual crimes and summary statistics from text files.
