# Text Processing Project

## Overview
This project is a **Java-based text processing application** that extracts, processes, and organizes crime statistics from the historical text *A Red Record* by Ida B. Wells. The program separates regular crime statistics, summarized crime statistics, and unnamed 1892 statistics, and saves the results in structured output files.

## Features
- **Extracts and organizes crime statistics** from a large text file.
- **Processes multiline and structured statistics** using regex and categorization.
- **Generates three output files**:
  - `CrimeStats.txt` – Contains individual crime statistics.
  - `SummarizedStats.txt` – Contains summarized crime statistics.
  - `UntitledSummarizedStats.txt` – Contains unnamed 1892 statistics.
